            <h2>A Candy for Everyone!</h2>
            <p>While Skittles originally used an animal-derived gelatin in its creation, they have since discontinued the usage of this gelatin, making this delicious candy suitable for even vegetarians, vegans, and anyone who'd understandably be unconfrotable with consuming that.
